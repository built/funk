"Oh how the funk lingers..." - George Clinton

funk helps you find dead or orphaned functions in your ruby code

You'll need ack installed or you'll get yelled at.

Usage: funk <source file> <project folder>

It works like this:

funk /projects/foo/app/models/account.rb /projects/foo

It spits out the name of any functions that it can't find used in your project directory

Funk is not 100% accurate. Your brain is still required. (Sorry!)
